## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial v1 release candidate.
- Configuration-driven multi-bot gateway — YAML config replaces hard-coded env-per-persona wiring.
- Two transports: webhook and polling, with per-bot overrides.
- Two built-in runners: `claude-code` and `command` (with `jsonl-text` + `claude-ndjson` protocols).
- Slash-command dispatcher with `builtin:reset`, `builtin:status`, `builtin:health`.
- SQLite state with WAL, crash recovery, outbox.
- Streaming message edits, safe attachment handling, default-deny ACL.
- Zod-validated strict config, `${VAR}` + `${VAR:-default}` env interpolation.
- Secret-redacting logger (both value-based and `/bot<TOKEN>/` URL-path redaction).
- `torana start|doctor|validate|migrate|version` CLI.
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint (opt-in).
- `examples/echo-bot/` smoke test.
